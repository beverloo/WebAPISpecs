 <section id='abstract'>
  <p>This specification defines a “Push API” that provides webapps (Web applications) with scripted access to server-sent application data, for simplicity referred to here as "Push messages" as delivered by "Push services". Push services are a way for servers to send messages to webapps, whether or not the webapp is active in a browser window.</p>
  <p>Push messages may be delivered via various methods, either standardized (e.g. delivered via <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/eventsource">[Server-Sent Events]</a> over connectionless network bearers such as SMS and OMA Push/SMS <a href="http://www.openmobilealliance.org/Technical/release_program/push_v2_3.aspx">[OMA-Push]</a>), or via browser-specific methods. The specific method to be used by a webapp is either selected by the user through selecting a Web Intent Push Service provider, or by the browser. The Push API is defined to promote compatibility with any underlying delivery method.</p>

 <section class='informative' id="introduction"><h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>As defined here, Push services support delivery of server messages in the following contexts and related use cases:<ul>
   <li>the user is actively involved in the use of a webapp: this relates to any normal use case in which a webapp user may benefit from Push messages while the user is actively using the webapp
   <li>the user is not actively involved in the use of a webapp, but the webapp is active in a window of the browser or executing as a web worker: this relates to use cases such as social networking, messaging, web feed readers, etc in which the user may not be actively using a webapp but still benefits from Push messages being sent to (or via) the webapp, to keep the user up-to-date
   <li>the webapp is not currently active in a browser window: this relates to use cases in which the user may close the webapp, but still benefits from the webapp being able to be restarted when a Push message is received, e.g. the WebRTC use case in which an incoming call can invoke the WebRTC webapp  
   <li>multiple webapps are running, but Push messages are delivered only to the webapp that requested them, e.g. any normal use case in which multiple webapps are active in the browser and utilizing Push services
   <li>multiple instances of the same webapp are active in the browser, and Push messages specific to each instance of the webapp are delivered only to the specific instance, e.g. when a mail webapp is active in two windows using different mail accounts
   <li>multiple instances of the same webapp are active in different browsers, and Push messages are delivered to a set of instances of the webapp, e.g. when a mail webapp is active in two browsers using the samemail account</li>
   <li>multiple instances of the same webapp are active in different browsers, and Push messages are delivered to all instances of the webapp, e.g. when a message is to be broadcasted to all users of the webapp

 <section id="pushframework"><h2>Push Framework</h2>
  <p>There are different deployment alternatives to allow webapp servers to deliver Push messages to webapps. In a typical deployment webapp servers send push messages to a Push server, e.g. by a RESTful interface, which in turn delivers the message to the user agent on top of which the webapp is running. The user agent delivers then the Push message to the corresponding webapp to which the Push message was addressed.</p>
  <p>This API allows webapps to ask the user for permission to receive Push messages and to provide the user agent with the necessary information to activate the Push service. For instance, the webapp provides a unique application token that is used by the webapp server when sending a message to the Push server to address an specific instance (or set thereof) of the application. In case several instances of a webapp register the same application token, e.g. in different user agents, then the Push server deliver Push messages addressed to that application token to all of those instances (e.g. when a mail webapp is active in two browsers using the same mail account)</p>
  <p>Also the webapp may provide additional information in order to allow the Push server to verify that Push messages come from the right webapp server. Namely it can provide a public key that the Push server can use to verify that the Push message comes from the right webapp server, which has signed the message with the associated private key</p>

    <dd>The object that exposes the Push service management interface.</dd>
  </dl>
 </section>
    
 <section id="pushmanager"><h1>The <a>PushManager</a> Interface</h1>
  <p>This interface defines the operations that enable webapps to establish access to Push services.</p>
  <dl title="interface PushManager" class="idl">
   <dt>PushService requestRemotePermission(DOMString appToken, optional DOMString publicKey, optional DOMString algorithm)</dt>
    <dd>Asks the user if they'd like to allow this webapp to receive Push messages. The webapp conveys an application token, which is a unique token generated by the application that identifies the instance (or set thereof) that is (are) intended to receivethe Push messages that are addressed to this application token by the webapp server. In case several instances of a webapp register the same application token, e.g. in different user agents, then the Push server <em title="must" class="rfc2119">must</em> deliver Push messages addressed to that application token to all of those instances(e.g. when a mail webapp is active in two browsers using the same mail account).  
      <p>In order to verify that Push messages received by the Push server come from the right webapp server, the webapp server <em title="may" class="rfc2119">may</em> sign Push messages. In case messages are signed by the corresponding webapp server then the webapp <em title="must" class="rfc2119">must</em> include in the <code>publicKey</code> attribute the public key that the Push server can use to verify the signature of Push messages.The default signature algorithm is RSA-SHA256, which <em title="must" class="rfc2119">must</em> be supported by Push servers, although the webapp may propse the use of a different algorithm. If the webapp wants to indicate the use of a different signature algorithm it will indicate it in the <code>algorithm</code> attribute, which will be enconded according to [[!XMLSEC-ALGORITHMS]]</p>
      <p>Upon success, a <code><a href="#pushservice">PushService</a></code> object is returned, with a Push service URL where the webapp server can send messages to this webapp. If the webapp has been granted permission already and is calling requestRemotePermission() again, the Push service URL will be returned without asking again for permission.</p>
   <dt>PushService checkRemotePermission(DOMString appToken)</dt>
    <dd>Lets the webapp ask the browser if the webapp has been granted permission to receive Push messages, without bothering the user. The success callback would return the same <code><a href="#pushservice">PushService</a></code> object that <code>requestRemotePermission()</code> received, but if the user has never allowed notifications for the webapp the error callback would run.</dd>
